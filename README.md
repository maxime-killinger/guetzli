# Introduction

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high
visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than
images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only
sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

# Using

**Note:** Guetzli uses a large amount of memory. You should provide 300MB of
memory per 1MPix of the input image.

**Note:** Guetzli uses a significant amount of CPU time. You should count on
using about 1 minute of CPU per 1 MPix of input image.

**Note:** Guetzli assumes that input is in **sRGB profile** with a **gamma of
2.2**. Guetzli will ignore any color-profile metadata in the image.

To try out Guetzli you need to [build](#building) or
[download](https://github.com/google/guetzli/releases) the Guetzli binary. The
binary reads a PNG or JPEG image and creates an optimized JPEG image:

```bash
guetzli [--quality Q] [--verbose] input_filename_1.jpg input_filename_2.jpg
guetzli [--quality Q] [--verbose] *.jpg
```

Note that Guetzli is designed to work on high quality images. You should always
prefer providing uncompressed input images (e.g. that haven't been already
compressed with any JPEG encoders, including Guetzli). While it will work on other
images too, results will be poorer. You can try compressing an enclosed [sample
high quality
image](https://github.com/google/guetzli/releases/download/v0/bees.png).

You can pass a `--quality Q` parameter to set quality in units equivalent to
libjpeg quality. You can also pass a `--verbose` flag to see a trace of encoding
attempts made or a `--keepmetadata` to keep the metadata inside your image. The
`--suffix VALUE` will add a suffix to the filename. By default, the suffix is
'compressed'. For example, for the file `input.jpg`, the output file will be named
`input.compressed.jpg`. To overwrite the existing file, use the `--overwrite`
parameter.

Please note that JPEG images do not support alpha channel (transparency). If the
input is a PNG with an alpha channel, it will be overlaid on black background
before encoding.
